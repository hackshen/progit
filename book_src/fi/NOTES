Chapter 1 - Line 56: 		What is a proper finnish translation for the word "snapshot" in this case? Translated now as 'tilannekuvat'.
						Multiline: 	What is a proper finnish translation for the word "commit" in this case? Or do we need it, is permanen change (like it is now) enought to tell what it is about?
						Chapter "The Three Stages" ("Kolme tilaa") has mentioned the "staged" word, what is correct translation for this in finnish? Was translated as "lavastettu".
                        -> "lavastettu" is an obvious but bad choice, because it's based on another meaning of "stage", not the one that Git uses. Now translated as "valmisteltu".
						Line 230:		Translation for a word "Backports"
